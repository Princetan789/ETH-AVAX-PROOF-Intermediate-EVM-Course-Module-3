#CryptoToken Smart Contract
CryptoToken is a Solidity smart contract that allows you to create your own ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract provides functionalities for minting new tokens, transferring tokens, burning tokens, approving allowances for other addresses, and transferring tokens on behalf of approved addresses.

##Features
Token Creation: The contract allows you to create a new ERC20 token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply.

Token Transfers: Users can transfer tokens from their account to another address.

Token Burning: Users can burn their tokens, reducing the total supply.

Minting: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens to a provided address.

Token Approvals: Users can approve other addresses to spend tokens on their behalf up to a certain allowance.

Token Transfers from Approved Addresses: Approved addresses can transfer tokens from a user's account within the approved allowance.

Pause Function: The contract owner can pause and unpause token transfers.

##Deployment
Deploy the CryptoToken contract on the Ethereum network using Remix or HardHat.

After deployment, the contract owner will have the ability to mint tokens, transfer ownership, and pause/unpause token transfers.

Users can interact with the contract to transfer tokens, burn tokens, approve allowances, and transfer tokens from approved addresses.

##Smart Contract Security
